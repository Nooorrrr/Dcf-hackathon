# 🌍 BarakaNet - A Digital Platform for Empowering Community Solidarity & Volunteerism

## 🔹 Overview  & functionality
Our platform connects volunteers with charities, making it easier for volunteers to find active charities nearby through an interactive map. Charities can post about upcoming events, volunteering opportunities, and items they need to borrow for their activities.
Each volunteer receives a unique QR code upon account creation, which they can use to check in when assisting at charity events. This allows charities to efficiently track volunteer participation.
Similarly, when an item is borrowed by a charity, a QR code is generated containing details such as the item’s description, quantity, and owner. This helps charities manage their inventory and track borrowed items seamlessly.
Our solution is designed to streamline charity operations, enhance inventory management, and connect charities with potential volunteers, making it easier for people to find meaningful ways to contribute.
